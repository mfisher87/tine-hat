# TineHat

An open hardware design for an electic hi-hat.

The TineHat is inspired by [Git-hat](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-gVMHY8_VY), with the objective to lose the guitar but enable similar expressive capabilities.
The basic idea is a metal resonator which can be muted by a hi-hat foot pedal and a repositionable electromagnetic pickup.
Optionally, could add volume and tone controls.

Resonator ideas:

* Piece of a cymbal cut up with an angle grinder
* Steel bar stock
* Tuning fork

It would be cool to design the resonator to be easily replacable.

The device body might be a piece of 2x4.
